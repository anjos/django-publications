The discrimination method is based on analyzing the time structure of calorimeter signals and achieves discrimination response smaller than 100 ns. Signals pass through a high performance constant fraction discriminator and events that lie in the confusion region of this discriminator are analyzed through a sub-optimal filltering technique based on pulse integration. The composed discrimination system achieves 98% electron eficiency with less than 0.1% of pions being misclassified as electrons.",

The system mainly uses neural networks for extracting rate events with physics significance from a huge background noise. It is based on processing the information collected from different detectors placed around the collision point. Combining a feature extraction phase for each detector with a global decision phase for final decision on discarding or not a given event, the system acts on events previously selected by a first-level analysis that reduces the event rate to 100 kHz. To cope with this input frequency, the proposed system is being emulated in a 16 node transputer base parallel machine that has a fast digital signal processor running as a co-procesor for each node.",

      "abstract": "The Atlas High Level Trigger's primary function of event selection will be accomplished with a Level-2 trigger farm and an Event Filter farm, both running software components developed in the Atlas offline reconstruction framework. While this approach provides a unified software framework for event selection, it poses strict requirements on offline components critical for the Level-2 trigger. A Level-2 decision in Atlas must typically be accomplished within 10 ms and with multiple event processing in concurrent threads. In order to address these constraints, prototypes have been developed that incorporate elements of the Atlas Data Flow -, High Level Trigger -, and offline framework software. To realize a homogeneous software environment for offline components in the High Level Trigger, the Level-2 Steering Controller was developed. With electron/gamma- and muon-selection slices it has been shown that the required performance can be reached, if the offline components used are carefully designed and optimized for the application in the High Level Trigger.\r\n\r\nA fun\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria dos Filtros de Alto N\u00edvel do experimento ATLAS ser\u00e1 implementada em dois n\u00edveis independentes de dete\u00e7\u00e3o operando em componentes de software.

De forma a atender a estas restri\u00e7\u00f5es, foram desenvolvidos prot\u00f3tipos que incorporam elementos do Sistema de Fluxo de Dados do ATLAS, dos Filtros de Alto N\u00edvel e do Sistema de Processamento Offline.

      "abstract": "The Trigger System of the ATLAS experiment reduces the rate of events produced by proton-proton collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in three successive steps from 40 MHz to ~ 100, 1 and 0.2 kHz respectively. The ATLAS Second Level Trigger is original in several ways. It makes use of information provided by the First Level Trigger which identifies Regions of Interest (RoI) indicating where the most significant activity has occurred within the detector. Accessing detector data in RoIs only reduces the estimated 100 Gbytes/s data rate by a factor 100. Appart from a custom interface to acquire the RoI information, the Second Level Trigger is implemented in software. Another cost saving approach is the development of Trigger Selection software in an offline environment using a common framework for the High Level Trigger and Reconstruction Software. Consequently, the Second Level Trigger draws on software developed in two largely independant domains: real time oriented dataflow software combined with offline selection software. In this paper we report on experience gained and results obtained with second generation prototype software of both domains. Test of the performance of the data collection have been carried out on testbeds consisting of PCs running Linux and interconnected by Gbit Ethernet switches. The selection software has been tested using simulated detector data preloaded in detector readout buffers.",

Subsequently, the High Level Trigger (HLT), which is comprised of the Second Level trigger and the Event Filter, will need to further reduce this rate by a factor of O(10^3).

In this paper an overview of the current implementation of the selection for electrons and photons in the HLT is given. The performance of this implementation has been evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations in terms of the efficiency for the signal channels, rate expected for the selection, data preparation times, and algorithm execution times. Besides the efficiency and rate estimates, some physics examples will be discussed, showing that the triggers are well adapted for the physics programme envisaged at LHC.

New was also to run algorithms in the online environment for the trigger selection and in the event filter processing tasks on a larger scale. A mechanism has been developed to package the offline software together with the DAQ/HLT software and to distribute it via peer-to-peer software efficiently to this large pc cluster. The findings obtained during the tests lead to many immediate improvements in the software. Trend analysis allowed identifying critical areas. Running an online system on a cluster of 700 nodes successfully was found to be especially sensitive to the reliability of the farm as well as the DAQ/HLT system itself and the future development will concentrate on fault tolerance and stability.\r\n\r\nO Sistema de Filtragem e Aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados do ATLAS (TDAQ) ter\u00e1 \u00e0 sua disposi\u00e7\u00e3o, inicialmente, 2000 PCs assuminido as fun\u00e7\u00e3o de controlar, ler e filtrar os dados dos eventos do experimento.

No total, 700 n\u00f3s de processamento foram utilizados no exerc\u00edcio.

To cope with this bandwidth, a highly programmable, three-level online triggering system is under development. One of the main components of this system is an electron/jet discriminator that uses the highly segmented calorimetry information. In this work, we address the electron/jet discrimination at the second-level trigger by building a set of concentric ring sums around the energy deposition peak in each calorimeter segment. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on these ring sums is then performed to extract the main sources of the calorimeter signal. The extracted independent components feed the input nodes of a neural electron/jet discriminator. The proposed system is able to achieve higher detection efficiency than the current electron/jet discriminating system operating in ATLAS, while being fast enough to cope with the time restrictions of the ATLAS triggering system operation.\r\n",

These concepts are described in the ATLAS Computing Model which embraces Grid paradigm. The output coming from the Event Filter consists of four main streams: physical stream, express stream, calibration stream, and diagnostic stream. The calibration stream will be transferred to the Tier-0 facilities that will provide the prompt reconstruction of this stream with a minimum latency of 8 hours, producing calibration constants of sufficient quality to allow a first-pass processing. The Inner Detector community is developing and testing an independent common calibration stream selected at the Event Filter after track reconstruction. It is composed of raw data, in byte-stream format, contained in Readout Buffers (ROBs) with hit information of the selected tracks, and it will be used to derive and update a set of calibration and alignment constants. This option was selected because it makes use of the Byte Stream Converter infrastructure and possibly gives better bandwidth usage and storage optimization. Processing is done using specialized algorithms running in the Athena framework in dedicated Tier-0 resources, and the alignment constants will be stored and distributed using the COOL conditions database infrastructure. This work is addressing in particular the alignment requirements, the needs for track and hit selection, and the performance issues.",

The computing instrument of the EF is generally organized as a set of independent sub-farms, each connected to one output of the Event Builder switch fabric. Each sub-farm comprises a number of processors analyzing several complete events in parallel. This paper describes the design of the ATLAS EF system, its deployment in the 2004 ATLAS combined test beam together with some examples of integrating selection and monitoring algorithms. Since the processing algorithms are not specially designed for EF but are inherited as much as possible from the off-line ones, special emphasis is reserved to system reliability and data security, in particular for the case of failures in the processing algorithms. Another key design element has been system modularity and scalability.

      "abstract": "During the runtime of any experiment, a central monitoring system that detects problems as soon as they appear has an essential role. In a large experiment, like ATLAS, the online data acquisition system is distributed across the nodes of large farms, each of them running several processes that analyse a fraction of the events. In this architecture, it is necessary to have a central process that collects all the monitoring data from the different nodes, produces full statistics histograms and analyses them. In this paper we present the design of such a system, called the gatherer. It allows to collect any monitoring object, such as histograms, from the farm nodes, from any process in the DAQ, trigger and reconstruction chain. It also adds up the statistics, if required, and processes user defined algorithms in order to analyse the monitoring data. The results are sent to a centralized display, that shows the information online, and to the archiving system, triggering alarms in case of problems. The innovation of this system is that conceptually it abstracts several underlying communication protocols, being able to talk with different processes using different protocols at the same time and, therefore, providing maximum flexibility. The software is easily adaptable to any trigger-DAQ system. The first prototype of the gathering system has been implemented for ATLAS and has been running during this year's combined test beam. An evaluation of this first prototype will also be presented.",

It is composed of two stages, the LVL2 trigger and the Event Filter (EF). The LVL2 trigger performs event selection with optimized algorithms using selected data guided by Region of Interest pointers provided by the LVL1 trigger. Those events selected by LVL2, are built into complete events, which are passed to the EF for a further stage of event selection and classification using off-line algorithms. Events surviving the EF selection are passed for off-line storage. The two stages of HLT are implemented on processor farms. The concept of distributing the selection process between LVL2 and EF is a key element in the architecture, which allows it to be flexible to changes (luminosity, detector knowledge, background conditions etc.) Although there are some differences in the requirements between these sub-systems there are many commonalities. An overview of the dataflow (event selection) and supervision (control, configuration, monitoring) activities in the HLT is given, highlighting where commonalities between the two sub-systems can be exploited and indicating where requirements dictate that implementations differ.

An extremely flexible solution is proposed that allows for early rejection of unwanted events and an easily configurable way to choose algorithms and to specify the criteria for trigger decisions. It is implemented in the standard ATLAS object-oriented software framework, Athena. The early rejection is achieved by breaking the decision process down into sequential steps. The configuration of each step defines sequences of algorithms which should be used to process the data, and 'trigger menus' that define which physics signatures must be satisfied to continue on to the next step, and ultimately to accept the event. A navigation system has been built on top of the standard Athena transient store (StoreGate) to link the event data together in a tree-like structure. This is fundamental to the seeding mechanism, by which data from one step is presented to the next. The design makes it straightforward to utilize existing off-line reconstruction data classes and algorithms when they are suitable",

The Level-1, implemented with custom hardware, identifies physics objects within Regions of Interests and operates a first reduction of the event rate to 75 KHz. The higher trigger levels provide a software based event selection which further reduces the event rate to about 100 Hz. This paper presents the algorithm (muFast) employed at Level-2 to confirm the muon candidates flagged by the Level-1. muFast identifies hits of muon tracks inside the Muon Spectrometer and provides a precise measurement of the muon momentum at the production vertex. The algorithm must process the Level-1 muon output rate (~20 KHz), thus a particular care has been used for its optimization. The result is a very fast track reconstruction algorithm with good physics performances which, in some cases, approach those of the offline reconstruction: it computes the pT of prompt muons with a resolution of 5.5% at 6 GeV and 4.0% at 20 GeV and with an efficiency of about 95%.

      "abstract": "The ATLAS trigger system is designed to select rare physics processes of interest from an extremely high rate of proton-proton collisions, reducing the LHC incoming rate of about 107. The short LHC bunch crossing period of 25 ns and the large background of soft-scattering events overlapped in each bunch crossing pose serious challenges, both on hardware and software, that the ATLAS trigger must overcome in order to efficiently select interesting events. The ATLAS trigger consists of hardware based Level-1, and a two-level software based High-Level Trigger (HLT). Data bandwidth and processing times in the higher level triggers are reduced by region of interest guidance in the HLT reconstruction steps. High flexibility is critical in order to adapt to the changing luminosity, backgrounds and physics goals. It is achieved by the use of inclusive trigger menus and modular software design. Selection algorithms have been developed which provide the required elasticity to detect different physics signatures and to control the trigger rates. In this paper an overview of the ATLAS trigger design, status and expected performance, as well as the results from the on-going commissioning with cosmic rays and first LHC beams, is presented.",

In its final configuration, O(20k) applications will provide the needed capabilities in terms of event selection, data flow, local storage and data monitoring. In preparation for the first LHC beams, many TDAQ sub-systems already reached the final configuration and roughly one third of the final processing power has been deployed. Therefore, the current system allows for a sensible evaluation of the performance and scaling properties. In this paper we introduce the ATLAS TDAQ system requirements and architecture and we discuss the status of software and hardware component. We moreover present the results of performance measurements validating the system design and providing a figure for the ATLAS data acquisition capabilities in the initial data taking period.",

      "abstract": "ATLAS is a multi-purpose spectrometer built to perform precision measurements of Standard Model parameters and is aiming at discovery of Higgs particle, Super Symmetry and possible other physics channels beyond Standard Model. Operating at 14 TeV center of mass energy ATLAS will see 40 million events per second at nominal luminosity with about 25 overlapping interactions. Most of the events are inelastic proton-proton interactions with only few W, Z bosons or ttbar pairs produced each second, and expectations for Higgs or SUSY production cross-section are much smaller than that. ATLAS trigger has a difficult task to select one out of 10 5 events online and to ensure that most physics channels of interests are preserved for analysis. In this talk we will review the design of ATLAS trigger system, the trigger menu prepared for initial LHC run as well as for high luminosity run. The expected trigger performance of the base-line ATLAS physics programs will be reviewed and first results from the commissioning period will be given. The methods to measure trigger efficiencies and biases directly from data will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "ATLAS is one of the two general-purpose detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The trigger system is responsible for making the online selection of interesting collision events. At the LHC design luminosity of 10^34 cm^-2s^-1 it will need to achieve a rejection factor of the order of 10^-7 against random proton-proton interactions, while selecting with high efficiency events that are needed for physics analyses. After a first processing level using custom electronics based on FPGAs and ASICs, the trigger selection is made by software running on two processor farms, containing a total of around two thousand multi-core machines. This system is known as the High Level Trigger (HLT). To reduce the network data traffic and the processing time to manageable levels, the HLT uses seeded, step-wise reconstruction, aiming at the earliest possible rejection of background events. The recent LHC startup and short single-beam run provided a \"stress test\" of the system and some initial calibration data. Following this period, ATLAS continued to collect cosmic-ray events for detector alignment and calibration purposes. After giving an overview of the trigger design and its innovative features, this paper focuses on the experience gained from operating the ATLAS trigger with single LHC beams and cosmic-rays.",

      "abstract": "Event selection in the Atlas High Level Trigger is accomplished to a large extent by reusing software components and event selection algorithms developed and tested in an offline environment. Many of these offline software modules are not specifically designed to run in a heavily multi-threaded online data flow environment. The Atlas High Level Trigger (HLT) framework based on the Gaudi and Atlas Athena frameworks, forms the interface layer, which allows the execution of the HLT selection and monitoring code within the online run control and data flow software. While such an approach provides a unified environment for trigger event selection across all of Atlas, it also poses strict requirements on the reused software components in terms of performance, memory usage and stability. Experience of running the HLT selection software in the different environments and especially on large multi-node trigger farms has been gained in several commissioning periods using preloaded Monte Carlo events, in data taking periods with cosmic events and in a short period with proton beams from LHC. The contribution discusses the architectural aspects of the HLT framework, its performance and its software environment within the Atlas computing, trigger and data flow projects. Emphasis is also put on the architectural implications for the software by the use of multi-core processors in the computing farms and the experiences gained with multi-threading and multi-process technologies.",

The LHC is expected to begin operations with a peak luminosity of 1031~cm\u22122s\u22121 with far fewer number of bunches, but quickly ramp up to higher luminosities.

At this rate the Event-Builder collects the data from all Read-Out system PCs (ROSs) and provides fully assembled events to the the Event-Filter (EF), which is the third level trigger, to achieve a further rate reduction to ~200 Hz for permanent storage. The Event-Builder is based on a farm of O(100) PCs, interconnected via Gigabit Ethernet to O(150) ROSs. These PCs run Linux and multi-threaded software applications implemented in C++. All the ROSs and one third of the Event-Builder PCs are already installed and commissioned.

These goals are achieved with a trigger composed of three sequential levels of increasing accuracy that have to reduce the output event rate down to ~100 Hz. This work focuses on muon reconstruction and identification for the third level (Event Filter), for which specific algorithms from the off-line environment have been adapted to work in the trigger framework. Two different strategies for accessing data (wrapped and seeded modes) are described and their reconstruction potential is then shown in terms of efficiencies, resolutions and fake muon rejection power.",

      "description": "The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has an interaction rate of up to 1 GHz. The trigger must efficiently select interesting events while rejecting the large amount of background. The First Level trigger will reduce this rate to around O(75 kHz ). Subsequently, the High Level Trigger (HLT), comprising the Second Level trigger and the Event Filter, will reduce this rate by a factor of O(1000). Triggering on taus is important for Higgs and SUSY searches at the LHC. In this paper tau trigger selections are presented based on a lepton trigger if the tau decays leptonically or via a dedicated tau hadron trigger if the tau disintegrates semileptonically. We present signal efficiency with the electron trigger using the data sample A=tau+tau=e+hadron, and rate studies obtained from the dijet sample.",

Its primary function is the reduction of data flow and rate to values acceptable by the mass storage operations and by the subsequent off-line data reconstruction and analysis steps. The computing instrument of the EF is generally organized as a set of independent sub-farms, each connected to one output of the Event Builder switch fabric. Each sub-farm comprises a number of processors analyzing several complete events in parallel. This paper describes the design of the ATLAS EF system, its deployment in the 2004 ATLAS combined test beam together with some examples of integrating selection and monitoring algorithms. Since the processing algorithms are not specially designed for EF but are inherited as much as possible from the off-line ones, special emphasis is reserved to system reliability and data security, in particular for the case of failures in the processing algorithms. Another key design element has been system modularity and scalability. The EF shall be able to follow technology evolution and should allow for using additional processing resources possibly remotely located.",

      "description": "During the runtime of any experiment, a central monitoring system that detects problems as soon as they appear has an essential role. In a large experiment, like ATLAS, the online data acquisition system is distributed across the nodes of large farms, each of them running several processes that analyse a fraction of the events. In this architecture, it is necessary to have a central process that collects all the monitoring data from the different nodes, produces full statistics histograms and analyses them. In this paper we present the design of such a system, called the gatherer. It allows to collect any monitoring object, such as histograms, from the farm nodes, from any process in the DAQ, trigger and reconstruction chain. It also adds up the statistics, if required, and processes user defined algorithms in order to analyse the monitoring data. The results are sent to a centralized display, that shows the information online, and to the archiving system, triggering alarms in case of problems. The innovation of this system is that conceptually it abstracts several underlying communication protocols, being able to talk with different processes using different protocols at the same time and, therefore, providing maximum flexibility. The software is easily adaptable to any trigger-DAQ system. The first prototype of the gathering system has been implemented for ATLAS and has been running during this year's combined test beam. An evaluation of this first prototype will also be presented.",

      "description": "The ATLAS High Level Trigger (HLT) system provides software-based event selection after the initial LVL1 hardware trigger. It is composed of two stages, the LVL2 trigger and the Event Filter (EF). The LVL2 trigger performs event selection with optimized algorithms using selected data guided by Region of Interest pointers provided by the LVL1 trigger. Those events selected by LVL2, are built into complete events, which are passed to the EF for a further stage of event selection and classification using off-line algorithms. Events surviving the EF selection are passed for off-line storage. The two stages of HLT are implemented on processor farms. The concept of distributing the selection process between LVL2 and EF is a key element in the architecture, which allows it to be flexible to changes (luminosity, detector knowledge, background conditions etc.) Although there are some differences in the requirements between these sub-systems there are many commonalities. An overview of the dataflow (event selection) and supervision (control, configuration, monitoring) activities in the HLT is given, highlighting where commonalities between the two sub-systems can be exploited and indicating where requirements dictate that implementations differ. An HLT prototype system has been built at CERN. Functional testing is being carried out in order to validate the HLT architecture.",

      "description": "Given the extremely high output rate foreseen at LHC and the general-purpose nature of ATLAS experiment, an efficient and flexible way to select events in the High Level Trigger is needed. An extremely flexible solution is proposed that allows for early rejection of unwanted events and an easily configurable way to choose algorithms and to specify the criteria for trigger decisions. It is implemented in the standard ATLAS object-oriented software framework, Athena. The early rejection is achieved by breaking the decision process down into sequential steps. The configuration of each step defines sequences of algorithms which should be used to process the data, and 'trigger menus' that define which physics signatures must be satisfied to continue on to the next step, and ultimately to accept the event. A navigation system has been built on top of the standard Athena transient store (StoreGate) to link the event data together in a tree-like structure. This is fundamental to the seeding mechanism, by which data from one step is presented to the next. The design makes it straightforward to utilize existing off-line reconstruction data classes and algorithms when they are suitable.",

      "description": "To cope with the 40 MHz event production rate of LHC, the trigger of the ATLAS experiment selects the events in three sequential steps of increasing complexity and accuracy whose final results are close to the offline reconstruction. The Level-1, implemented with custom hardware, identifies physics objects within Regions of Interests and operates a first reduction of the event rate to 75 KHz. The higher trigger levels provide a software based event selection which further reduces the event rate to about 100 Hz. This paper presents the algorithm (muFast) employed at Level-2 to confirm the muon candidates flagged by the Level-1. muFast identifies hits of muon tracks inside the Muon Spectrometer and provides a precise measurement of the muon momentum at the production vertex. The algorithm must process the Level-1 muon output rate (~20 KHz), thus a particular care has been used for its optimization. The result is a very fast track reconstruction algorithm with good physics performances which, in some cases, approach those of the offline reconstruction: it computes the pT of prompt muons with a resolution of 5.5% at 6 GeV and 4.0% at 20 GeV and with an efficiency of about 95%. The algorithm requires an overall execution time of ~1 ms on a 100 SpecInts95 machine.",
